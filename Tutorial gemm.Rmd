### Introduction

In this tutorial the function  ` moderatedMediationSem() ` is described for the analysis of moderated mediation models. The function is an alternative for the (SPSS or SAS) PROCESS macro developped by Hayes (2018). The ` moderatedMediationSem ` is in the R package ` gemm `. This package can be installed from Github and then loaded using the `library()` function: 

` devtools::install_github("PeterVerboon/gemm") ` 
` library(gemm) `. 


```{r chunk1, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

library(gemm)

```

&nbsp;

An illustration of the moderated mediation model, for which the function can be applied, is shown in Figure 1. The figure represents a structural model, linking the observed variables to each other. We are therefore using the SEM software to fit the moderated mediation model. To this end we use the lavaan package (Rosseel, 2012). Figure 1 shows the most general situation, with several mediators, several covariates for the mediators and several covariates for the dependent variable. There are also two moderators in this model, one for the paths from the predictor to the mediators and one for the paths from the mediators to the dependent variabele.

The function ` moderatedMediationSem() ` calls the functions `buildModMedSemModel()`, which is also in the gemm package and which builds the requested SEM model. After running the function ` moderatedMediationSem() ` there are two methods available that are designed to handle the results: `plot()` and `print()`. These functions will be illustrated in this tutorial.
 

### Examples
The required parameters of the function ` moderatedMediationSem() ` can be found by typing `?moderatedMediationSem`.
This gives the help page of the function. The data that will be used to illustrate the model are included in the package and are in the R object `gemmDat`, which can be loaded by `data("gemmDat")`. After loading the data, you can also learn more about the data by using the question mark.

```{r chunk2, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE, warning = FALSE}

?moderatedMediationSem   # shows the help page of the function
data("gemmDat")          # loads the data
?gemmDat                 # shows the desciption page of the data

```
The data have simple and obvious variable names: x and y for the predictor and dependent variable, respectively. The "m" with a number represents mediators and the "c" covariates, numerical moderators start with  "mod" , dichotomous moderators with "bi".

#### The mediation model

The first model that will be illustrated is a straightforward mediation model with three mediators, without moderators and without covariates. The number of bootstrap samples is set to 100, a very small number for bootstraps, but here only used for illustration. 

```{r model1, eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE, warning = FALSE}

result <- moderatedMediationSem(dat = gemmDat, 
                                xvar ="x1", 
                                mvars = c("m1","m2","m3"),
                                yvar = "y1",
                                nboot = 100)
```

The parameter "xvar" represents the predictor, "yvar" the dependent variable and "mvars" a vector of mediators. The results of the analysis is put the object "result". Except for nboot, these parameters are all obligatory to specify. This implies that you cannot run a simple regression model with this function.
The results can be viewed by typing: ` print(result)`.

```{r model1R, eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE, warning = FALSE}

print(result)

```

The printed output consists of four parts. First, the function input is shown. Here you can check whether you have specified the model that you intended to run. Second, the explained variance is shown for the dependent variable and the mediators. For the dependent variable the variance is explained by the predictor, the mediator(s), and optionaly also by the covariate(s).For the mediators the variance is explained by the predictor, and optionaly also by the covariate(s). 
The third part shows the direct effect of the predictor on the dependent variable. The confidence interval around this estimate has been obtaind by using the bootstrap samples.
The fourth part shows the indirect effects. eachh row represent an indirect effect through a partical mediator. The last row is the total of all indirect effects. Again boostrap samples are used to obtain the estimates.
Finally, the standardized indirect effects are given, one for each mediator. They represent the completely standardized effect size of the indirect effect.

#### The moderated mediation model

In the next example a moderated mediation model is shown.

```{r model2, eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE, warning = FALSE}

result <- moderatedMediationSem(dat = gemmDat, 
                             xvar  = "x1", 
                             mvars = c("m1","m2"), 
                             yvar  = "y1",
                             mymod = "bimod2", 
                             cmvars = c("c1","c2"), 
                             cyvars = c("c1","c2"),
                             nboot = 100)

print(result)
```


Here we have moderator ("bimod2") added to the model. This variable is assumed to moderate the two effects of the two mediators on the dependenet variable. This moderator is a dichotomous moderator, in r terminology a factor with two levels (e.g. male and female). The variables c1 and c2 are used as covariates. They are used two times, first as covariates of the mediators (cmvars) and also as covariates of the dependent variabele (cyvars).
The structure of the printed output is similar to the previous analyses. However, we can ask for plots now, because the model contains a moderator. The command is simply `plot(result)` to ask for plots. There actually are two plot types. The first type plots de index of moderated mediation (Hayes, 2018, p.425) as function of the moderator. The index of moderated mediation (IMM) is the slope of the line representing the effect of the mediator (c.q. predictor) on the dependent variable (c.q. mediator) that changes when the moderator changes. When there are two mediators in the model there are also two IMMs. A flat horizonal line indicates that the slope does not change as a function of the supposed moderator, in that case there is no moderation. This plot is only given for numerical, non-dichotomous moderators.
The second plot type is the simple slope plot. A simple slope plot shows the indirect effect of the predictor on the dependent variable through a mediator for usually two characteristic values of the moderator. Each value of the moderator is represented by a separate line. Parallel lines indicate absence of moderation and crossing lines the presence of moderation. For each mediator a separate plot is given. 
  
```{r model2R, eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
plot(result)
```

These plots show the effect of the predictor on the dependent variable through the mediators m1 and m2, respectively. Because the moderator is a dichotomous variable each plot contains two lines, one for each category of the moderator.

&nbsp;
As a final example we illustrate the use of a numerical moderator.

```{r model3, eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE, warning = FALSE}

result <- moderatedMediationSem(dat = gemmDat, 
                             xvar  = "x1", 
                             mvars = c("m1","m2"), 
                             yvar  = "y1",
                             xmmod = "mod2", 
                             cmvars = "c1", 
                             nboot = 100)

print(result)
plot(result)
```


The plot command provides four plots, for each mediator a plot of the IMM and a simple slopes plot. The lines represent one standard deviation below or above the mean of the moderator. Between the two plots is a table with the simple slopes, together with their 95% coverage interval obtained from the bootstrap.

####  Additional output

The results object is a list of three elements, which are named input, intermediate, and results, respectively. Input contains the original data and all variable names used in the analysis. Intermediate contains results that have been computed in the functions. For instance the object `results$intermediate$model ` contains the model specification that was used by lavaan, the object `results$intermediate$result ` contains the output of lavaan. You can inspect this output by loading the package lavaan and then using 'summary(results$intermediate$result)'. All other lavaan extract functions can be used on this object. The object 'res$intermediate$parameterEstimates' contains all estimated parameters from lavaan.
